<h1>About</h1>

<h1>Interests</h1>
<p>My hobbies are reading and singing. I also like to bake and cook.</p>
<h1>My CCA</h1>
<p>My CCA is Choir. I have been in Choir since primary school. The seniors in DHS Choir are very friendly and they make choir even more enjoyable than it already is. I love to sing so I think that Choir gives me a wonderful oppurtunity to do what I love.</p>
